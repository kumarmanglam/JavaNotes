### Method Overloading in Java
If a [class](https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java) has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as **Method Overloading**.

There are two ways to overload the method in java
1. By changing number of arguments
2. By changing the data type

>Method overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only because of ambiguity

### Method Overloading and Type Promotion
If a [class](https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java) has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as **Method Overloading**.
One type is promoted to another implicitly if no matching datatype is found.

### Method Overriding in Java

If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as **method overriding in Java**.
#### Rules for Java Method Overriding

1. The method must have the same name as in the parent class
2. The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
3. There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).

### Can we override static method?

No, a static method cannot be overridden. It can be proved by runtime polymorphism, so we will learn it later
It is because the static method is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with an object. Static belongs to the class area, and an instance belongs to the heap area

### Can we override java main method?

No, because the main is a static method.

## Covariant Return Type

since Java5, it is possible to override method by changing the return type if subclass overrides any method whose return type is Non-Primitive but it changes its return type to subclass type


### Example 
Imagine you have a TV remote. This remote has buttons like "power," "volume up," and "channel down." When you press these buttons while pointing at a Samsung TV, the TV turns on, increases volume, or changes the channel. Now, if you take the same remote and point it at an LG TV, the buttons still do the same basic functions: turn the TV on, increase the volume, or change the channel. Even though the internal mechanisms of the Samsung and LG TVs might be different, the remote's buttons behave the same way. This idea is similar to polymorphism in Java.

In Java:

- The TV remote is like an interface or a superclass with methods (buttons).
- Different TV brands, like Samsung and LG, are like subclasses.
- The fact that you can use the same remote (or method call) on different TVs (or objects) and expect the same type of behavior is polymorphism!

In more technical terms: Polymorphism in Java allows us to treat different objects in the same way based on their common behaviors (or methods). Even if the way they carry out these behaviors is different, we can call the methods in the same manner.
