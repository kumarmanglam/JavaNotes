==Class and Interface which defines the different data structure for storing the collection of element.== 
It provides an architecture which can be readily be used to perform various tasks.
### Example

![[collection]]

**Collection**: Group of Elements (Integers, String, User Defined Data types)
It has better storage, optimized search. 
It provides readymade ds implementation.
## Class and Interface for Storing Collections of Elements


## List Interface

- Contains ordered elements.
- Supports index-based search, random access, and easy insertion.
- May include duplicates and nulls.

### ArrayList

- Implements the `List` interface and is based on resizable arrays.
- Allows dynamic resizing of the array to accommodate adding or removing elements.
- Offers fast element access through index-based retrieval.
- Not synchronized, meaning it's not thread-safe for concurrent access from multiple threads.

### LinkedList

- Doubly linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces.
- Not synchronized.
- Allows sequential access to elements.
- Offers fast addition and deletion of data.
- Does not support random access.

### Vector

- Similar to ArrayList but synchronized.
- Suitable for multi-threaded environments where multiple threads access a list concurrently.

### Stack

- Extends Vector with methods that allow a stack data structure.
- Follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

### Stack Class

- Provides a standard last-in-first-out stack operation.

### Queue Interface

## Queue

### PriorityQueue

- Implements a priority queue based on the priority heap.
- Elements are ordered by their natural ordering or by a Comparator provided at the queue construction time.
- doesn't allow null
- Addition/deletion are much efficient

### Deque

- Interface that maintains ordering and allows random access and manipulation.
- Implemented by two classes: `ArrayDeque` and `LinkedList`.
- Allows duplicates and null elements.

### ArrayDeque

- Resizable array-based implementation of the Deque interface.
- Not thread-safe.
- Offers better performance than LinkedList in most situations.

## Set Interface

- Collection that contains no duplicate elements.
- Allows random access.
- Extends the Collection interface and is implemented by four classes: `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `EnumSet`, `TreeSet`.

### HashSet

- Does not allow duplicate values.
- Uses hashing for implementation.
- Provides random ordering.
- Offers constant-time access.
- Initial capacity is 16, and load factor is 0.75.

### LinkedHashSet

- Special type of HashSet.
- Uses Doubly Linked List for its implementation.
- Maintains order.
- Implements the List interface.
- Does not allow duplicates.

### TreeSet

- Implements a Red-Black tree-based NavigableSet.
- Provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for basic operations.
- Maintains elements in sorted order.
