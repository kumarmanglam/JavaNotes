- Throws is used when we don't want to handle the exception
- Throws can specify multiple exception
- Caller can handle the exception or propagate to its caller.
- Checked exception must be thrown

either write catch or throw the exception.


## Throw

```java
catch(ArithmeticException e){
	throw new ArithmeticException("custom")
}
```

### Try-with-Resources
- less verbose
- passes the responsibility of closing down of resources to java

### User defined exceptions
- create your custom exceptions when the existing ones don't fit your business logic
- Have full control on the lifecycle of exceptions
- Choose wisely who is the parent of your custom exception
- If we extend exception then your exception is checked. If we extend runTimeException then our exception is unchecked exception.
