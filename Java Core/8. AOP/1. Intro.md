Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in AspectJ allows developers to modularize cross-cutting concerns in their applications. AspectJ provides various types of advices to define how ==aspects should interact with the join points in the program flow==. Here are the commonly used types of advices in AspectJ:

1. **@Before**: Advice executed before the join point. It allows you to perform actions before the method is invoked.
    
2. **@AfterReturning**: Advice executed after a join point completes normally (i.e., without throwing an exception).
    
3. **@AfterThrowing**: Advice executed if a join point throws an exception.
    
4. **@After**: Advice executed ==after the join point regardless of its outcome== (success or failure).
    
5. **@Around**: Advice that surrounds a join point, ==allowing you to control both the join point's execution and the flow of control around== it.


```java
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.*;

@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.MyService.*(..))")
    public void beforeAdvice() {
        System.out.println("Before advice: Logging the method execution..." + "started at" + new Date());
    }

    @AfterReturning(pointcut = "execution(* com.example.MyService.*(..))", returning = "result")
    public void afterReturningAdvice(Object result) {
        System.out.println("After returning advice: Logging the method execution with result: " + result);
    }

    @AfterThrowing(pointcut = "execution(* com.example.MyService.*(..))", throwing = "exception")
    public void afterThrowingAdvice(Exception exception) {
        System.out.println("After throwing advice: Logging the exception: " + exception.getMessage());
    }

    @After("execution(* com.example.MyService.*(..))")
    public void afterAdvice() {
        System.out.println("After advice: Logging after method execution regardless of outcome.");
    }

    @Around("execution(* com.example.MyService.*(..))")
    public Object aroundAdvice(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Around advice: Before invoking method...");
        Object result = null;
        try {
            result = joinPoint.proceed();
            System.out.println("Around advice: After method invocation...");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Around advice: Exception thrown: " + e.getMessage());
            throw e;
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Around advice: Finally block executed.");
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
