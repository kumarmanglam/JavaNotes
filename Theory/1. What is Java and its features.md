It is 
- High level language
- platform independent
- oops language
- secure (java code is converted to byte code)

Java is a **programming language** and a **platform**. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

>Java is a write once, run anywhere language

Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:

### Secured
- **No explicit pointer**
- **Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox**
- **Classloader:** Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is used to load Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically. It adds security by separating the package for the classes of the local file system from those that are imported from network sources.
- **Bytecode Verifier:** It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.
- **Security Manager:** It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.
### Multi-threaded

A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.

### Dynamic

Java is a dynamic language. It supports the dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++.

Java supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management (garbage collection).

```java
|**To compile:**|javac Simple.java|
|**To execute:**|java Simple|
```

#### Executing methods

### JVM
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

The JVM performs the following main tasks:

- Loads code
- Verifies code
- Executes code
- Provides runtime environment
### JRE
JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is also written as Java RTE. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime

### JDK

JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and [applets](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-applet). It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.

### What is JVM
It is:

1. **A specification** where working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. But implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm. Its implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies.
2. **An implementation** Its implementation is known as JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
3. **Runtime Instance** Whenever you write java command on the command prompt to run the java class, an instance of JVM is created

The JVM performs following operation:

- Loads code
- Verifies code
- Executes code
- Provides runtime environment

JVM provides definitions for the:

- Memory area
- Class file format
- Register set
- Garbage-collected heap
- Fatal error reporting etc.

### 1) Classloader

Classloader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files. Whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by the classloader. There are three built-in classloaders in Java.

1. **Bootstrap ClassLoader**: This is the first classloader which is the super class of Extension classloader. It loads the _rt.jar_ file which contains all class files of Java Standard Edition like java.lang package classes, java.net package classes, java.util package classes, java.io package classes, java.sql package classes etc.
2. **Extension ClassLoader**: This is the child classloader of Bootstrap and parent classloader of System classloader. It loades the jar files located inside _$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext_ directory.
3. **System/Application ClassLoader**: This is the child classloader of Extension classloader. It loads the classfiles from classpath. By default, classpath is set to current directory. You can change the classpath using "-cp" or "-classpath" switch. It is also known as Application classloader.

### Type Casting

#### Implicit type casting

	smaller -> larger
	short -> int
### Explicit type casting
	larger -> smaller
	int -> short
	short a;
	int b;
	a = (short) b;

```java
int grade = 'B';
System.out.println(grade); //66
```



i/o

```java
import java.util.Scanner;class Main {public static void main(String[] args) {// declare variables and assign values
	int num = 1;// declare variables and assign values
	int num1;
	float num2;
	char character;
	boolean bool;
	String str;
	double num3;
	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	System.out.println("enter int value ");
	num1 = sc.nextInt();
	
	System.out.println("enter float value ");
	num2 = sc.nextFloat();
	
	System.out.println("enter string value ");
	str = sc.next();
	
	System.out.println("enter double value ");
	num3 = sc.nextDouble();
	
	System.out.println("enter boolean value ");
	bool = sc.nextBoolean();
	
	System.out.println("enter character value ");
	character = sc.next().charAt(0);
	
	System.out.println("int -> " + num1);
	System.out.println("float -> " + num2);
}
```

### What are packages?

• Logical grouping of related classes together
• Inspired from how you arrange folders on your computer
• Grouped by functionality
• Grouped by reason to change
• Encapsulation
