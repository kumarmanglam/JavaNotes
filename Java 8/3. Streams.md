## Java 8 Stream API

#### What is Collection:
A collection refers to ==any group of individual objects represented as a single unit==.

#### What is Stream:
A stream is ==used to process collections of objects==. It supports various methods that can be pipelined together to produce the desired result. 

A stream pipeline consists of:
- A source (which might be an array, a collection, a generator function, an I/O channel, etc.)
- ==Zero or more== intermediate operations
- ==Exactly one== terminal operation

#### Syntax:
```java
default Stream<E> stream() {
    return StreamSupport.stream(spliterator(), false);
}

Stream<String> stream = collectionObj.stream();
```

#### Advantages of Stream:
1. ==**Lazy Initialization**==: Streams employ lazy initialization on each intermediate operation.
2. **Non-Mutating**: Streams ==do not change the original data structure==; they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.

In the next video, we will explore different Intermediate and Terminal operations in Streams.

#### Stream API Operations

The Stream API contains two different types of operations to provide desired end results:
- Intermediate operations and Terminal operations.
#### 1. Intermediate Operations:

- Intermediate operations ==return another stream as a result==. They can be chained together to form a pipeline of operations.
- The pipeline of operations may contain any number of intermediate operations.
- ==Intermediate operations are lazily loaded==. When you call intermediate operations, they are actually not executed. They are just stored in memory and ==executed when the terminal operation is called on the stream==.
- Intermediate operations do not return end results; they simply convert streams into another stream.

**Example methods for Intermediate Operations:**
- `filter()`, `map()`, `flatMap()`, `distinct()`, `sorted()`, `limit()`, `skip()`

#### 2. Terminal Operations:

- Terminal operations will compute the stream data and ==return non-stream values as end results==, ==such as primitives, objects, collections, or nothing==.
- Terminal operations ==cannot be chained together==, and there should be only one terminal operation, placed at the end of the pipeline.
- Terminal operations are ==eagerly loaded, ==and they produce the end result.

**Example methods for Terminal Operations:**
- `collect()`, `forEach()`, `toArray()`, `reduce()`, `min()`, `max()`, `count()`, `anyMatch()`, `allMatch()`, `noneMatch()`, `findFirst()`, `findAny()`

### Java 8 Stream API: Difference between Intermediate and Terminal Operations

| Operations      | Intermediate Operations                                                         | Terminal Operations                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Return Type     | Returns a Stream                                                                | Returns non-stream values (e.g., primitives, objects)                                                                                                 |
| Chaining        | Can be pipelined with one or more intermediate operations                       | Cannot be chained; there should be only one terminal operation                                                                                        |
| Lazy Evaluation | Lazily loaded; executed only when a terminal operation is called                | Eagerly loaded; produce end result immediately                                                                                                        |
| End Result      | Does not produce any end result                                                 | Produces end result                                                                                                                                   |
| Example Methods | `filter()`, `map()`, `flatMap()`, `distinct()`, `sorted()`, `limit()`, `skip()` | `collect()`, `forEach()`, `toArray()`, `reduce()`, `min()`, `max()`, `count()`, `anyMatch()`, `allMatch()`, `noneMatch()`, `findFirst()`, `findAny()` |
### `filter()`

#### Java 8 Stream API

The `filter()` method ==returns a stream consisting of the elements of the current stream that match the given predicate==. It takes a ==`Predicate` reference as an argument==. Since `Predicate` is a functional interface, you can also pass a lambda expression here.

1. **Type**: `filter()` method is an Intermediate operation.
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: The `filter()` method is lazy, meaning it will not be evaluated until you call a Terminal operation.

#### Syntax:
```java
Stream<T> filter(Predicate<? super T> predicate);
```

#### Usage:
Use the `filter()` method in stream operations when you want to check some conditional operation on the elements of a given collection or input stream.

Example:
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
Stream<Integer> filteredStream = numbers.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0);
```

In this example, `filter()` is used to create a stream containing only the even numbers from the `numbers` list.

### `map()`

#### Java 8 Stream API

The `map()` method returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of the current stream. It ==transforms one object stream to another object stream== by applying a function.

1. **Type**: `map()` is an Intermediate operation.
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: The `map()` method is also lazily initialized, meaning it will not be evaluated until you call a Terminal operation.

#### Syntax:
```java
<R> Stream<R> map(Function<? super T, ? extends R> mapper)
```

- `R`: Denotes the element type of the new Stream.
- `? super T`: Represents that the original Stream should have values that are a superclass of type `T`.
- `? extends R`: Allows the method taken by `map()` to be declared as returning a subtype of `R`.
- `mapper`: It is the stateless and non-interfering function that gets applied to each element of the Stream and produces a new Stream of values.

#### Usage of Map:
Use the `map()` method to convert a stream of objects of one type to a stream of objects of another type.

Example:
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Mike", "Peter", "Raju");
List<Integer> nameLengths = names.stream().map(String::length).collect(Collectors.toList());
```

In this example, `map()` is used to convert a stream of strings representing names to a stream of integers representing their lengths.


### `flatMap()`

#### Java 8 Stream API

The `flatMap()` method in the Stream API is ==used to flatten a Stream of collections/arrays into a Stream of objects==. It applies a ==one-to-many transformation to the elements== of the stream and then flattens the resulting elements into a new stream.

- **Flattening**: Flattening ==refers to merging multiple collections/arrays into one==.

Example:
Before flattening: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`
After flattening: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`

The `flatMap()` operation is a combination of flattening and mapping.

#### Usage:

```java
<R> Stream<R> flatMap(Function<? super T, ? extends Stream<? extends R>> mapper)
```

- `T`: The type of the elements in the ==original stream.==
- `R`: The type of the elements in the ==resulting stream==.
- `mapper`: A ==function that takes an element of type `T` and returns a stream of elements of type `R`==.
- It ==converts nested stream `stream<stream T>` into flat stream `stream<R>`==

Example:
```java
List<List<Integer>> listOfLists = Arrays.asList(
    Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3),
    Arrays.asList(4, 5),
    Arrays.asList(6, 7, 8)
);

List<Integer> flattenedList = listOfLists.stream()
                                        .flatMap(Collection::stream)
                                        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

In this example, `flatMap()` is used to flatten a list of lists of integers into a single list of integers.

### Difference between Map() and FlatMap()
| Aspect            | `map()`                                   | `flatMap()`                                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Processing       | Processes a stream of values             | Processes a stream of stream of values              |
| Input Type       | `Stream<T>`                               | `Stream<Stream<T>>`                                 |
| Output Type      | `Stream<R>`                               | `Stream<R>`                                         |
| Operation        | Performs one-to-one mapping               | Performs one-to-many mapping                        |
| Mapper Function  | Produces a single value for each input    | Produces multiple values for each input             |
| Transformation  | Transforms `Stream<T>` to `Stream<R>`     | Transforms `Stream<Stream<T>>` to `Stream<T>`       |

### distinct():

Java 8 Stream API - `distinct()`

- The `distinct()` method is used for ==filtering or collecting all the distinct objects== from a stream. The elements are ==compared using the `Object.equals(Object)` method==.

Syntax:
```java
Stream<T> distinct()
```

#### Key Points:

A. The `distinct()` guarantees the ordering for the streams backed by an ordered collection. The element appearing first in the encounter ==order is preserved== for ordered streams.

B. ==For unordered streams, no stability guarantees== are made.

C. This is a stateful intermediate operation.

D. If you are ==working on Custom objects like `Customer` or `Student`, you must override the `Object` class `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods== to get unique results.



### **`sorted()`** 

The `sorted()` method in Java 8 Stream API is used to sort the elements of a stream. There are two overloaded versions of this method:

1. `Stream<T> sorted()`: This method provides the default natural sorting order for elements.
    - Returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to the ==natural sorting order==.
    - If the elements of this stream are not `Comparable`, a `java.lang.ClassCastEx3ception` may be thrown when the terminal operation is executed.
    - For ==ordered streams, the sort is stable==, meaning the relative order of equal elements is preserved.
    - For ==unordered streams, no stability guarantees are made==.
    - This is a stateful intermediate operation.

2. `Stream<T> sorted(Comparator<? super T> comparator)`: This method sorts the elements based on a ==customized sorting order== provided by the specified `Comparator`.

 When provided with a `Comparator`, it sorts the elements of the stream based on the provided comparator. Here are some key points about the `sorted()` method:

1. It returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to the provided `Comparator`.
2. For ordered streams, ==the sort is stable==, meaning the relative order of equal elements is preserved.
3. For ==unordered streams, no stability guarantees== are made.
4. This is a stateful intermediate operation.



###  limit()

The `limit()` method in Java 8 Stream API is used to return a new Stream consisting of the elements of the given stream, ==truncated to be no longer than a specified maximum size (`maxSize`).== Here are some key points about the `limit()` method:

- `Stream<T> limit(long maxSize)`

1. `limit()` returns the first `n` elements in the encounter order of the stream.
2. While `limit()` is generally a cheap operation and has less expense on sequential stream pipelines, ==it can be quite expensive on unordered parallel pipelines==, especially for large values of `maxSize`.
3. The `limit()` ==method is a short-circuiting intermediate operation==. An intermediate operation is short-circuiting if, when presented with infinite input, it may produce a finite stream as a result==. It means that the operation can terminate processing early if the desired limit has been reached, even if the input stream is infinite==. Note that a terminal operation is short-circuiting if, when presented with infinite input, it may terminate in finite time.

### skip()

The `skip()` method in Java 8 Stream API returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of ==this stream after discarding the first `n` elements== of the stream. Here are some key points about the `skip()` method:

- `Stream<T> skip(long n)`

1. Returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first `n` elements of the stream.
2. If this stream contains fewer than `n` elements, then an empty stream will be returned.
3. Note: The method may== throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if `n` is negative==.
4. The `skip()` method is a stateful intermediate operation. Stateful operations, such as `distinct` and `sorted`, may incorporate state from previously seen elements when processing new elements.
5. Generally, `skip()` is a cheap operation. However, ==it can be quite expensive on ordered parallel pipelines, especially for large values of `n`.==
6. Using an unordered stream source or removing the ordering constraint with `BaseStream.unordered()` may result in significant speedups of `skip()` in parallel pipelines.

### Terminal Operations

Terminal operations in Java 8 Stream API are used to ==compute the stream data and return non-stream values as end results==. They mark the end of the stream pipeline and produce final results. Here are some key characteristics and methods related to terminal operations:

#### Characteristics of Terminal Operations:

a) Terminal operations compute the stream data and return non-stream values as end results, **such as primitives, objects, collections, or they may not return anything**.
b) Terminal operations ==cannot be chained together==, and there should be only one terminal operation at the end of the pipeline.
c) ==Terminal operations are eagerly loaded, meaning they produce end results as soon as they are executed.==

#### Example Methods for Terminal Operations:

1. `collect()`: ==Collects the elements of the stream into a collection or other data structure==.
2. `forEach()`: Performs an action for each element of the stream.
3. `toArray()`: Converts the stream elements into an array.
4. `reduce()`: Reduces the stream to a single value by performing a binary operation on the elements.
5. `min()`: Finds the minimum element in the stream according to the provided comparator.
6. `max()`: Finds the maximum element in the stream according to the provided comparator.
7. `count()`: Counts the number of elements in the stream.
8. `findFirst()`: Finds the first element in the stream.
9. `findAny()`: Finds any element in the stream.
10. `anyMatch()`: Checks if any elements of the stream match the given predicate.
11. `allMatch()`: Checks if all elements of the stream match the given predicate.
12. `noneMatch()`: Checks if none of the elements of the stream match the given predicate.

#### Terminal Methods: toArray()

The `toArray()` method in Java 8 Stream API is a terminal operation used to ==convert the stream of objects into an array of objects==. There are two different ways to perform this conversion:

1. `Object[] toArray()`: Returns an array containing the elements of this stream.

2. ==`<T> T[] toArray(IntFunction<T[]> generator)`==: Returns an array containing the elements of this stream, using the provided generator function to allocate the returned array, as well as any additional arrays that might be required for a partitioned execution or for resizing. 
 
The ==generator function takes an integer, which is the size of the desired array==, and produces an array of the desired size. This can be concisely expressed with an array constructor reference:

```java
String[] stringArray = stream.toArray(String[]::new);
String[] stringArray = stream.toArray(x -> new String[x])
```

###  min()

The `min()` method in the Java 8 Stream API is a terminal operation used to select the ==smallest== element in the ==stream according to the `Comparator`== used for comparing the elements. Here are some key points about the `min()` method:

1. This is a terminal operation.
2. It ==returns an `Optional<T>` describing the minimum element of this stream, or an empty `Optional==` if the stream is empty.
3. It throws `NullPointerException` if the minimum element is null.
### findFirst()

The `findFirst()` method in the Java 8 Stream API is a terminal operation used to ==return an `Optional`== describing the first element of the stream, or an empty `Optional` if the stream is empty. Here are some key points about the `findFirst()` method:

1. This is a short-circuiting terminal operation, meaning it ==may terminate processing as soon as the first element is found==.
2. It returns an `Optional<T>` describing the first element of this stream, or an empty `Optional` if the stream is empty.
3. If the ==stream has no encounter order (e.g., parallel streams), then any element may be returned==.
4. It ==throws `NullPointerException` if the element selected is null.==
// 11234564778890 findfinst(4)
// 112345
// 64778890
### anyMatch()

The `anyMatch()` method in the Java 8 Stream API is a short-circuiting terminal operation used to determine if at least one element in the stream matches the condition provided by the predicate. Here are some key points about the `anyMatch()` method:

1. This is a ==short-circuiting terminal operation==, meaning it may terminate processing as soon as the first matching element is encountered.
2. It returns a ==boolean indicating whether any elements of this stream match the provided predicate==.
3. If the ==stream is empty, then `false` is returned,== and the predicate is not evaluated.
4. It may not evaluate the predicate on all elements if not necessary for determining the result. The method returns `true` as soon as the first matching element is encountered.

### noneMatch()

The `noneMatch()` method in the Java 8 ==Stream API is used to check that the stream does not contain any element matching the provided predicate==. Here are some key points about the `noneMatch()` method:

- It returns a boolean value:
  - `true` if no element in the stream matches the given predicate, or if the stream is empty.
  - ==`false` if at least one element matches the given predicate==.
- This is a terminal operation.
- It is a short-circuiting terminal operation, meaning it may terminate processing as soon as a matching element is encountered.

### reduce()

The `reduce()` method in the Java 8 Stream API is a terminal operation used to perform a reduction on the elements of the stream. It uses an ==associative accumulation function and returns an `Optional` describing the reduced value==, if any. Here are some key points about the `reduce()` method:
```
123456
acc = acc + curr 21
curr =6
```
- A reduction operation (also called a fold) takes a sequence of input elements and combines them into a single summary result by repeated application of a combining operation.
- It ==applies the accumulator function repeatedly to combine elements of the stream until only one result remains==.
- The `BinaryOperator` interface represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands. ==It is a functional interface whose functional method is `BiFunction.apply(Object, Object)`.==
- The `reduce()` method returns an `Optional` describing the reduced value. If the stream is empty, it returns an empty `Optional`.

- **T**: Type of the data in the stream.
- **identity**: Defines the initial value of the reduction operation.
- ==**accumulator**: Function to combine two va==lues, which are the partial result of the reduction operation and the next element of the stream.
- The identity value must be an identity for the accumulator function. This means that for all `t`, `accumulator.apply(identity, t)` is equal to `t`.
- The accumulator function must be an associative function.


## Parallel Streams 
- Utilizes multiple cores of processor
![[Pasted image 20240216204155.png]]

In the Java 8 Stream API, `parallelStream` is a mechanism to execute streams in parallel, leveraging multiple cores for faster processing. Here are some key points about parallel streams:

- ==Normally, Java code or streams are executed/processed sequentially==.
- By using parallel streams, the code can be divided into multiple streams that are executed in parallel on separate cores, and the final result is the combination of the individual outcomes.
- ==Note that the order of execution is not under our control, so the final results of the stream may not be in order==.

#### Creating Parallel Streams:

1. **Using `BaseStream.parallel()`:** You can convert any sequential stream into a parallel stream using the `parallel()` method provided by the `BaseStream` interface.

    ```java
    Stream<Integer> sequentialStream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    Stream<Integer> parallelStream = sequentialStream.parallel();
    ```

2. **Using `Collection.parallelStream()`:** You can directly create a parallel stream from a collection using the `parallelStream()` method provided by the `Collection` interface.

    ```java
    List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    Stream<Integer> parallelStream = list.parallelStream();
    ```

Example Usage:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class ParallelStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        
        Stream<Integer> numberStream = numbers.stream();
        // Using BaseStream.parallel()
        Stream<Integer> parallelStream1 = numberStream.parallel();
        
        // Using Collection.parallelStream()
        Stream<Integer> parallelStream2 = numberStream.parallelStream();
    }
}
```


In the Java 8 Stream API, the `parallelStream` mechanism allows for parallel execution of streams, leveraging multiple cores for faster processing. Here's some information about `parallelStream`:

#### BaseStream.parallel():

- The `parallel()` method is an intermediate operation available in the base interface for streams, `BaseStream`.
- It returns an equivalent parallel stream.
- Parallel streams divide the work into multiple streams that are executed in parallel on separate cores.
- The output of ==parallel streams may be unordered or unpredictable==, as the order of execution is not guaranteed.

Example Usage:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class ParallelStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        
        // Using BaseStream.parallel()
        Stream<Integer> parallelStream = numbers.stream().parallel();
        
        // Perform parallel operations on the stream
        parallelStream.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}

```

### Comparison between **Stateless Operations** and stateful

| Characteristic      | Stateless Operations                                      | Stateful Operations                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Dependency on State | Operate independently on each element                     | Depend on the state of other elements.              |
| Order of Processing | Process each element independently                        | May require buffering or sorting elements           |
| Parallelizability   | Generally more suitable for parallel processing           | May have limitations or overhead in parallelization |
| Examples            | `map()`, `filter()`, `flatMap()`, `peek()`, `unordered()` | `distinct()`, `sorted()`, `limit()`, `skip()`       |

Examples:

1. **Stateless Operations**:
   - `map()`: Applies a function to each element independently.
   - `filter()`: Filters elements based on a predicate without dependency on other elements.
   - `flatMap()`: Processes each element independently and flattens nested streams.
   - `peek()`: Allows performing side-effects for each element independently.
   - `unordered()`: Advises the stream pipeline not to preserve the order of elements.

2. **Stateful Operations**:
   - `distinct()`: Requires maintaining state to eliminate duplicates.
   - `sorted()`: Sorts elements based on their state or a specified comparator.
   - `limit()`: Limits the size of the stream based on the state.
   - `skip()`: Skips elements based on the state.
   - `peek()`: Although it's stateless, if used for debugging or logging, it may rely on the state of elements.

In summary, while stateless operations process each element independently and are generally more suitable for parallel processing, stateful operations depend on the state of other elements and may require additional processing overhead. It's important to understand the characteristics of each type of operation when designing stream pipelines in Java.
