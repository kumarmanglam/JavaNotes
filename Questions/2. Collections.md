## Why Map doesn't extent the Collection interface

- map ==interface follows key/value pair structure==. where collection is collection of objects
- add(E e) in collection doesn't support key/value pair


## Difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterations

 - Fail-fast ==Iterators throws ConcurrentModificationException== when one Thread is iterating over collection object and other thread structuring modify collection.
 - Fail-safe doesn't throw any exception because it ==works on clone of collection== instead of original collection. 


## What do you understand by BlockingQueue

- java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue, represents a ==queue which is thread safe==. 
- Its capable of blocking the thread that try to insert to take elements from the queue. For instance, if a thread tries to take an elements and there are none left in the queue, the thread can be blocked until there is an element to take.

## Difference between Synchronized collection and concurrent collection?

- Both synchronized and concurrent collection classes provide thread safety
- The difference between them comes in performance, scalability and they achieve thread-safety.
- ==Synchronized collections like synchronised HashMap are much slower than their concurrent counterparts e.g. ConcurrentHashMap, Main reason for this slowness is locking==.

## Why is char[] preferred over String for passwords?

- Strings are immutable and are stored in String pool. Once string is created, it stays in the pool in memory until being garbage collected.
- If you use mutable object like a character array, for example, to store the value, you can set it to blank once you are done with it with confidence that it will no longer be retained in memory.


## How to traverse or loop over a Map in java

- iterating using foreach loop
- iterating map using keySet iterator
- looping using EntrySet
- iterating using Entry Set

## How is WeakHashMap differ from other HashMap?

- An entry in WeakHashMap will automatically be removed when its key is not longer in ordinary use. ==Garbage Collector dominates over WeakHashMap.==

- In HashMap, even if key not having any reference which points to that key is not eligible for Garbage collection because its associated with the entry object added in bucked of hashMap. ==HashMap dominated over the gabage collector==
