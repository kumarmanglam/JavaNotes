A variable is a container which holds the value while the [Java program](https://www.javatpoint.com/simple-program-of-java) is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type.

Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.

There are two types of [data types in Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types): primitive and non-primitive.

#### 1) Local Variable

A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.

A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.

#### 2) Instance Variable

A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable. It is not declared as [static](https://www.javatpoint.com/static-keyword-in-java).

It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.

#### 3) Static variable

A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.

### Data Types
#### It has 8 Primitive data types
size
1. int 4biits
2. byte 8bits
3. short 16bits
4. long 64bits
5. float 32 bits
6. double 64 bits
7. boolean 1bit
8. char 16bits

## Short Data Type

The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive). Its minimum value is -32,768 and maximum value is 32,767. Its default value is 0.

The short data type can also be used to save memory just like byte data type. A short data type is 2 times smaller than an integer.

**Example:**

1. short s = 10000, short r = -5000  

## Int Data Type

The int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between - 2,147,483,648 (-2^31) to 2,147,483,647 (2^31 -1) (inclusive). Its minimum value is - 2,147,483,648and maximum value is 2,147,483,647. Its default value is 0.

The int data type is generally used as a default data type for integral values unless if there is no problem about memory.

**Example:**

[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)

1. int a = 100000, int b = -200000  

## Long Data Type

The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63) to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807(2^63 -1)(inclusive). Its minimum value is - 9,223,372,036,854,775,808and maximum value is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Its default value is 0. The long data type is used when you need a range of values more than those provided by int.

**Example:**

[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)

1. long a = 100000L, long b = -200000L  

## Float Data Type

The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.Its value range is unlimited. It is recommended to use a float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. The float data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency. Its default value is 0.0F.

**Example:**

[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)

1. float f1 = 234.5f  

## Double Data Type

The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its value range is unlimited. The double data type is generally used for decimal values just like float. The double data type also should never be used for precise values, such as currency. Its default value is 0.0d.

**Example:**

[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)

1. double d1 = 12.3  

## Char Data Type

The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. Its value-range lies between '\u0000' (or 0) to '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).The char data type is used to store characters.

**Example:**

[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)[](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types#)

1. char letterA = 'A'  

### Why char uses 2 byte in java and what is \u0000 ?

It is because java uses Unicode system not ASCII code system. The \u0000 is the lowest range of Unicode system. To get detail explanation about Unicode visit next page.
