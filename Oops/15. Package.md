## Java Package

A **java package** is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.

There are three ways to access the package from outside the package.

1. import package.*;
2. import package.classname;
3. fully qualified name.

### Ways to load the class files or jar files

- Temporary
    - By setting the classpath in the command prompt
    - By -classpath switch
- Permanent
    - By setting the classpath in the environment variables
    - By creating the jar file, that contains all the class files, and copying the jar file in the jre/lib/ext folder.
