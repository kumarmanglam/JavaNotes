### Points to Remember while creating the Lambda Expressions:

1. ==The type of the parameters can be declared explicitly, or it can be taken from the context, it means that compiler will identify the type automatically==

For example:
```java
Public void addition(int a,int b);
InterfaceName I = (a,b) -> a+b;
```

2. If there is a single parameter, the type and is parentheses are not mandatory to use.
Example:
```java
public void square(int a);
a ->a*a;
```

3. If the body has one statement, curly brackets are not required, and the value of the expression is returned.
4. If the body has more than one statement, curly brackets are required, and if the expression returns a value, it must return with a return statement.
5. ==In order to use a lambda expression, you first need a functional interface==.



# Functional Interface

Functional Interfaces with Respect to Inheritance

1. If an interface extends Functional Interface and child interface does not contain any abstract method then child interface is also a Functional Interface.

2. In the Child Interface we can define exactly same as parent Interface abstract method then both the interfaces are Functional Interfaces. In this case not throws any compile time errors.

3. In the child interface we can't define any new abstract methods otherwise child interface won't be Functional o interface. Compiler will throws an exception " Invalid '@FunctionalInterface' annotation; "
