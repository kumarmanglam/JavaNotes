Static can be: 
1. Variable (also known as a class variable)
2. Method (also known as a class method)
3. Block
4. Nested class

* The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.
* The static variable can be used to refer to the common property of all objects (which is not unique for each object), for example, the company name of employees, college name of students, etc.
- The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
- A static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
- A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
- A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

There are two main restrictions for the static method. They are:

1. The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
2. this and super cannot be used in static context.

### Why is the Java main method static?

Ans) It is because the object is not required to call a static method. If it were a non-static method, [JVM](https://www.javatpoint.com/jvm-java-virtual-machine) creates an object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.

There can be a lot of usage of **Java this keyword**. In Java, this is a **reference variable** that refers to the current object.

If local variables(formal arguments) and instance variables are different, there is no need to use this keyword like in the following program:

```java
1. Student(int rollno,String name,float fee){  
2. rollno=rollno;  
3. name=name;  
4. fee=fee;  
5. }
```
