Thread - It is smallest unit of execution. It is independent path of execution in a program.
### **Thread Lifecycle:**

- A thread goes through various states: `New`, `Runnable`, `Blocked`, `Waiting`, `Timed Waiting`, and `Terminated`.
- The `start()` method initiates the thread and moves it from the `New` state to the `Runnable` state.

### **Thread Operations**

Thread class is present inside java.lang package.
- *getName* return the name of thread
- *setName(String name)*  set the name of thread
- *run()* contains the **task** of thread
- *start()* start thread by allocating resources
- *getId()* return id of thread
- *setPriority() getPriority()* set and get priority
- *sleep() join() interrupt() resume() stop().... etc*

```java
//If you to get the current thread running
Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
syso(t.getName);
```


### Daemon Thread
- These are threads that provide service to other thread.
- Garbage collector is best example of Daemon thread.


### Producer Consumer Problem...
### Synchronised Inter-thread Communications

Producer should only produce when previous item produced is already consumed, meaning that the buffer is empty.
