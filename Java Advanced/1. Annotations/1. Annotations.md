# Annotations in Java 🚀

## Advantages of Annotations 🌟

1. **Configuration with Minimal Code:** Annotations reduce the need for verbose XML configurations. Keep your code clean and concise.
    
2. **Provide Additional Information:** Annotations, like `@Override`, offer extra details. For instance, `@Override` indicates method overriding.

Tags / metadata (It provides the extra Information)
Can be applied on class/interface/methods/fields

## Types of Annotations 📝

1. **Built-in Annotations 🏗️**
    
    - `@Override`: Indicates method overriding.
    - `@SuppressWarnings`: Suppresses compiler warnings.
    - `@Deprecated`: Marks deprecated class/method/field.
    
    Note: `@Override` throws an error if the method overridden lacks the same signature.
    
2. **User-Defined Annotations 🤖**
    
    - **@interface FirstAnnotations:**
        - Should not have a throws clause.
        - Returns enum/class/string/type.
        - Should not have parameters.
        - Uses `@interface` and may assign a default value.

### Built in Annotations
1. @Override (used to indicate that method is overridden)
2. @SupressWarning (suppress compiler warnings)
3. @Depreciated (Indicate that class method/field is depreciated)

Note:
@override will throw error if method overridden does not have same signature.

## User-Defined Annotations 🎨

### Target 🎯
```java
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
```
Specifies where the annotation can be applied (class, interface, enumeration).

### Retention ⏳
```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
```
ndicates at what level the annotation will be available (source, class, runtime).

### Inherited 🧬
```java
@Inherited

```
Marks the annotation to be inherited by subclasses.

### Three Types of User-Defined Annotations 📑

1. **Marker Annotations 🚩**
```java
@interface MyAnnotations {}
```
2. **Single-Value Annotations 📊**
```java
@interface SecondAnnotation {
    int value();
}
```
3. **Multi-Value Annotations 📈**
```java
@interface ThirdAnnotation {
    int value();
    String secondMethod();
}
```


@interface FirstAnnotations()
Rules
- should not have any throws clause
- should return one of the following data types: enum/class/string/type
- should not have any parameter
- prefix @interface
- it may assign a default value to the method

## User Defined
user Defined Annotations make use of following ==inbuilt== annotations:-
**Target**
```java
@Target (ElementType.TYPE) 
```
ElementType.TYPE this specify that annotation can be applied to class, interface and enumeration. Indicates that the annotation can be applied to other annotations.
@target will specify at which type, the annotation is used.
**interface**
Element Type can be - Type, Field, Method, Constructor, Local Variable, Annotation type, Parameter 
```java
@interface FirstAnnotations{
	int method();
}
```
**retention**
Indicate at what level the annotation will be available (source/ class/ Runtime)
Specifies that the annotation will only be available at the source level and won't be included in the compiled bytecode.
```java
@Retention
@interface FirstAnnotation{
	int method();
}
```
**inherited**
Marks the annotations to be inherited to the subclass. 
```java
@Inherited

@interface MyAnnotation { }

@interface MyAnnotation { }

class Superclass{}

class Subclass extends Superclass{}
```
By default, annotations are not inherited to subclasses. The @Inherited built-in annotation makes the annotation to be inherited by subclasses.

## Summary 📌

1. **Metadata:** Annotations provide extra information.
2. **Types:** Native (built-in) or User-Defined.
3. **Application:** Interfaces, classes, methods, and fields.

Annotations simplify configuration and enhance code readability, offering a powerful toolset for Java developers. 🌐
