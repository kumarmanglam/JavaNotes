## Iterable Interface
It has only one method -> iterator()
returns object of iterator
With help of this object we can iterate any collection
**All the classes of collection framework implements iterable**

## Why Map doesn't extent the Collection interface

- map interface follows key/value pair structure. where collection is collection of objects
- add(E e) in collection doesn't support key/value pair


## Difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterations

 - Fail-fast Iterators throws ConcurrentModificationException when one Thread is iterating over collection object and other thread structuring modify collection.
 - Fail-safe doesn't throw any exception because it works on clone of collection instead of original collection. 


## What do you understand by BlockingQueue

- java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue, represents a queue which is thread safe. 
- Its capable of blocking the thread that try to insert to take elements from the queue. For instance, if a thread tries to take an elements and there are none left in the queue, the thread can be blocked until there is an element to take.
