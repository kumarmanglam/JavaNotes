Thread - ==It is smallest unit of execution. It is independent path of execution in a program.==
### **Thread Lifecycle:**

- A thread goes through various states: `New`, `Runnable`, `Blocked`, `Waiting`, `Timed Waiting`, and `Terminated`.
- The `start()` method initiates the thread and moves it from the `New` state to the `Runnable` state.

### **Thread Operations**

Thread class is present inside java.lang package.
- *getName* return the name of thread
- *setName(String name)*  set the name of thread
- *run()* contains the **task** of thread
- *start()* start thread by allocating resources
- *getId()* return id of thread
- *setPriority() getPriority()* set and get priority
- *sleep() join() interrupt() resume() stop().... etc*

```java
//If you to get the current thread running
Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
syso(t.getName);
```


### Daemon Thread
- These are threads that provide service to other thread.
- This thread stop abruptly if other thread are done with their task.
- Garbage collector is best example of Daemon thread.


### Producer Consumer Problem...
### Synchronised Inter-thread Communications

Producer should only produce when previous item produced is already consumed, meaning that the buffer is empty.

### Commonly used methods of Thread class:

1. **public void run():** is used to perform action for a thread.
2. **public void start():** starts the execution of the thread.JVM calls the run() method on the thread.
3. **public void sleep(long miliseconds):** Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease execution) for the specified number of milliseconds.
4. **public void join():** waits for a thread to die.
5. **public void join(long miliseconds):** waits for a thread to die for the specified miliseconds.
6. **public int getPriority():** returns the priority of the thread.
7. **public int setPriority(int priority):** changes the priority of the thread.
8. **public String getName():** returns the name of the thread.
9. **public void setName(String name):** changes the name of the thread.
10. **public Thread currentThread():** returns the reference of currently executing thread.
11. **public int getId():** returns the id of the thread.
12. **public Thread.State getState():** returns the state of the thread.
13. **public boolean isAlive():** tests if the thread is alive.
14. **public void yield():** causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.
15. **public void suspend():** is used to suspend the thread(depricated).
16. **public void resume():** is used to resume the suspended thread(depricated).
17. **public void stop():** is used to stop the thread(depricated).
18. **public boolean isDaemon():** tests if the thread is a daemon thread.
19. **public void setDaemon(boolean b):** marks the thread as daemon or user thread.
20. **public void interrupt():** interrupts the thread.
21. **public boolean isInterrupted():** tests if the thread has been interrupted.
22. **public static boolean interrupted():** tests if the current thread has been interrupted.
