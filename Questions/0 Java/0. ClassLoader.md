# 1) Explain about class loader Subsystem in Java? Can you implement your own Class Loader in Java?

- ==The JavaClassLoader is a part of the **Java Runtime Environment** that dynamically loads Java classes into Java Virtual Machine==.
- **The JVM** is not required to know about files and file systems because of classloaders.
- All classes are not loaded into memory at one, whenever it requires **Java classloader** loads dynamically.
- Depending on the **type of class and the path of the class**, the ClassLoader loads the particular class.

**Types of class loaders in class loader subsystem**
1. Bootstrap class loader
2. Extension class loader
3. Application class loader/System class loader

### 1) Bootstrap class loader: 

- It is responsible to load classes from bootstrap class path. here bootstrap class path means, usually in java application **internal JVM users rt.jar**
- All classes like String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, java.lang, java.io are available here.
- `jdk --> jre --> lib --> rt.jar`
### 2) Extension class loader:

- Child of Bootstrap. Loads class from **extension class path.** 
- `jdk --> jre --> lib --> ext --> *.jar`

### 3) Application class loader:

- Child of Extension. Loads classes from application class path (classes in our application)

## Principles of functionality of a JavaClassLoader

1. Delegation model
2. Visibility principle
3. Uniqueness property

### 1) Delegation Model: 

- The JVM and Java ClassLoader uses an algorithm called **Delegation Hierarchy Algorithm**. 

 ==The classloader works on a set of operation given by delegation model. They are==

- ClassLoader always follows the **Delegation Hierarchy Principle**. 
- Whenever JVM comes across a class, it checks whether that **class is already loaded or not**.
- If the Class is already loaded in the method area then the JVM proceeds with execution.
- If the class is not present in the method area then the JVM asks the Java ClassLoader Sub-System to load that particular class. 
- **Bootstrap ClassLoader will search in the Bootstrap classpath**(JDK/JRE/LIB). If the class is available then it is loaded, if not the request is delegated to Extension ClassLoader.
- **Extension ClassLoader searches for the class in the Extension Classpath** (JDK/JRE/LIB/EXT). If the class is available then it is loaded, if not the request is delegated to the Application ClassLoader. 
- **Application ClassLoader searches for the class in the Application Classpath**. If the class is available then it is loaded, if not then a ClassNotFoundException exception is generated.

### 2) Visibility Principle:

The Visibility Principle states that a class loaded by a parent ClassLoader is visible to the child ClassLoaders **but a class loaded by a child ClassLoader is not visible to the parent ClassLoaders**.

- Suppose a class JavaTest.class has been loaded by the Extension ClassLoader, then that class is only visible to the Extension ClassLoader and Application ClassLoader but not to the Bootstrap ClassLoader.
- If that class is again tried to load using Bootstrap ClassLoader it gives an exception **java.lang.ClassNotFoundException**.
### 3) The Uniqueness Property

- **It ensures that the classes are unique and there are no repetition of classes**. This also ensures that the classes loaded by parent classloaders are not loaded by the child classloaders.
- If the parent class loader isn't able to find the class, only then the current instance would attempt to do so itself.

## Methods in Java.lang.ClassLoader


- After the JVM requests for the class, a few steps are to be followed in order to load a class. ==The Classes are loaded as per the delegation model==.
-  **loadClass(String name, boolean resolve):** This method is used to load the classes which are referenced by the JVM. It takes the name of the class as a parameter. This is of type loadClass(String, boolean).
- **defineClass():** The defineClass() method is a final method and cannot be overridden. This method is used to define a array of bytes as an instance of class. If the class is invalid then it throws ClassFormatError. findClass(String name): This method is used to find a specified class. *This method only finds but doesn't load the class*.
- **findLoadedClass(String name):** This method is used to verify whether the Class referenced by the JVM was previously loaded or not.
- **Class.forName(String name, boolean initialize, ClassLoader loader):** This method is used to load the class as well as initialize the class. This method also gives the option to choose any one of the ClassLoaders. If the ClassLoader parameter is NULL then Bootstrap ClassLoader is used.


## Custom Class Loader:

Sometimes we may not satisfy with default class loader mechanism then we can go for Customized
class loader.

- Default class loader loads .class file only once even though we are using multiple times that class in our program. **After loading .class file if it is modified outside, then default class loader won't load updated version of .class file on fly**, because .class file already there in method area.
- To overcome this problem we are going to customized class loader.
- ==**public class Customized ClassLoader extends ClassLoader**==
