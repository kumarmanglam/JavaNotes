1. What is a Stream in Java and how does it differ from collections?
   - A Stream in Java is a sequence of elements that supports various operations to perform computations on those elements. Unlike collections, which store elements, streams don't hold data; they operate on the elements of collections or other data sources.

2. Explain the difference between intermediate and terminal operations in Java Streams.
   - ==Intermediate operations are operations that can be chained together and produce a new stream as a result==. They are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked. Terminal operations, on the other hand, produce a result or a side-effect and trigger the execution of the entire stream pipeline.

3. How can you create a Stream from different data sources in Java?
   - Streams can be created from various data sources such as collections, arrays, files, or even ==generated using stream-generating methods like Stream.of(), Stream.iterate(), or Stream.generate().==

4. Discuss the significance of lazy evaluation in Java Streams.
   - ==Lazy evaluation means that elements of a stream are processed only when needed==. This allows for more efficient use of resources, especially when dealing with large datasets, as it avoids unnecessary computations.

5. What are the benefits of using Streams in Java programming?
   - Some benefits of using Streams in Java programming include concise and expressive code, improved readability, better support for parallel processing, and reduced chance of errors due to immutability.

6. Explain the concept of a pipeline in Java Streams.
   - ==A pipeline in Java Streams represents a sequence of operations performed on a stream==. It consists of a source, zero or more intermediate operations, and a terminal operation. Each intermediate operation produces a new stream, which is then processed by subsequent operations.

7. How do you perform filtering operations on a Stream in Java?
   - Filtering operations on a Stream can be performed using the filter() method, which takes a Predicate as an argument and returns a new Stream containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate.

8. Discuss the use of map() function in Java Streams and provide an example.
   - The map() function in Java Streams is used to transform each element of the stream using a given function. For example, you can use map() to convert a stream of strings to a stream of their lengths: `stream.map(String::length)`.

9. **Explain the difference between forEach() and map() operations in Java Streams.**
   - The ==forEach() operation performs an action for each element of the stream==, whereas the ==map() operation transforms each element of the stream using a function and returns a new stream with the transformed elements==.

10. How do you handle optional values returned by Stream operations in Java?
    - Optional values returned by Stream operations can be handled using methods like findFirst(), findAny(), or reduce(). Additionally, you can use methods like ifPresent() or orElse() to provide default values or perform actions if the optional is empty.

11. Discuss the concept of parallel streams and when they should be used.
    - Parallel streams in Java allow for concurrent processing of elements, potentially improving performance on multi-core processors or when dealing with large datasets. They should be used when the operations performed on the stream are computationally intensive and can be executed in parallel without interfering with each other.

12. What are the common terminal operations available in Java Streams?
    - Common terminal operations in Java Streams include ==forEach(), collect(), reduce(), count(), min(), max(), findFirst(), findAny(), anyMatch(), allMatch(), noneMatch(), and toArray().==

13. Explain how to use reduce() function in Java Streams with an example.
    - The reduce() function in Java Streams is used to combine the elements of a stream into a single result. For example, you can use reduce() to find the sum of all elements in a stream of integers: ==`int sum = stream.reduce(0, Integer::sum)`.==

14. How do you ==convert a Stream to a List== in Java?
    - You can convert a Stream to a List in Java using the collect() terminal operation with Collectors.toList() as the collector. 
    - For example, ==`List<String> list = stream.collect(Collectors.toList())`==.

15. Discuss the performance considerations when using Streams in Java.
    - Performance considerations when using Streams in Java include the overhead of creating streams, the potential overhead of using parallel streams, and the impact of lazy evaluation on performance. It's important to profile and benchmark your code to ensure that Streams are being used efficiently.
