## Object Cloning in Java

The **object cloning** is a way to create exact copy of an object. The clone() method of Object class is used to clone an object.

The **java.lang.Cloneable interface** must be implemented by the class whose object clone we want to create. If we don't implement Cloneable interface, clone() method generates **CloneNotSupportedException**

### Why use clone() method ? <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/object-cloning">link</a>

The **clone() method** saves the extra processing task for creating the exact copy of an object. If we perform it by using the new keyword, it will take a lot of processing time to be performed that is why we use object cloning.
