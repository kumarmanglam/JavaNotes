- **Functional Interfaces and Lambda Functions**: Prerequisites for understanding method references. Functional interfaces represent a single abstract method, making them suitable for lambda expressions.
- **Usage of Methods as Values**: In Java 8, methods can be treated as objects or primitive values, allowing them to be assigned to variables and passed as arguments to functions.
- **Syntax of Method References**:
    - **Object Method Reference**: `Object::methodName`
    - **Example**: `System.out::println` for printing elements in a list.
- **Benefits**:
    - Compactness: Method references provide a clearer and shorter alternative to lambda expressions, especially when calling existing methods.
    - Readability: Enhances code clarity and conciseness, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Limitation**: Method references can only replace a single method call in a lambda expression.
- **Usage Over Anonymous Classes**: Method references offer a cleaner alternative to anonymous classes for single method calls.
- **No Need for Arguments**: Method references can often be used without explicitly passing arguments.

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");

// Lambda expression
list.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s));

// Method reference
list.forEach(System.out::println);
```

In summary, method references provide a convenient way to simplify code by replacing lambda expressions that merely call existing methods with more concise syntax, improving code readability and maintainability
