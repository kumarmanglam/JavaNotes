### Multiple inheritance is not supported through class in java, but it is possible by an interface, why?

As we have explained in the inheritance chapter, multiple inheritance is not supported in the case of [class](https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java) because of ambiguity. However, it is supported in case of an interface because there is no ambiguity. It is because its implementation is provided by the implementation class

we can have method body in interface. But we need to make it default method.
we can have static method in interface.
An interface can have another interface which is known as a nested interface.
